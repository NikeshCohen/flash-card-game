# Flashcard App

This is a simple flashcard app that helps you learn new words. The app randomly selects a word from a list of words, and you have to guess the English translation. If you get it right, the word is removed from the list. If you get it wrong, the word is shown to you again.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Tkinter
- Pandas (to install the Pandas module run the following command: pip install pandas )

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the requirements.
3. Run the app with python main.py.

## How to use

The app will start by loading a list of words from the data/french_words.csv file. The words in the list will be in French, and you have to guess the English translation.

To guess the translation, click on the Wrong button if you do not know English translation, or click on the Right button if you do know the translation.

If you get the translation right, the word will be removed from the list. If you get it wrong, the word will be shown to you again.

The app will continue to show you words until you have learned all of them.

I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
